This project documents my journey solving 30+ real-world SQL problems from platforms like DataLemur and StrataScratch, based on actual interview questions from companies like Amazon, Airbnb, and Spotify.  
ðŸ“Œ Goal: Prepare for data analyst interviews and build a portfolio of reusable SQL snippets for common business analysis scenarios.

ðŸ§  Skills Practiced
QL Aggregation: GROUP BY, SUM, COUNT

Ranking & TopN logic: ROW_NUMBER(), RANK() with PARTITION BY

Time-based filters and trends: LAG(), DATEDIFF()

Subqueries, CTEs, Window Functions

Business KPIs: revenue, retention, active user classification, funnel conversion
